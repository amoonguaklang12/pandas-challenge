# pandas-challenge

This challenge demonstrates my understanding of the Pandas library as well as various functions on how to create, read, update, and delete data from dataframes, as well as how to use aggregate functions on existing data.

The PyCitySchools directory includes a Resources directory where the data sets that were used can be found. It also contains the PyCitySchools.ipynb file that contains the majority of the code.

My analysis of the data is included below:

It would seem that the highest five performing schools for this district based on % Overall passing are all Charter schools. This may indicate that Charter schools have a different curriculum that lead to a higher rate of passing for their students.

On the other hand, the five lowest performing schools are all District schools with their overall passing rates as low as 52%, which is nearly half as high as the Charter Schools.

Charter schools tend to perform significantly better than District schools with an average passing rate of 90.43% vs District's average of 53.67%.

If we look at Schools by school size or the total number of students, Small and Medium sized schools have a higher passing rate than Large schools (89.88% and 90.62% vs. 58.29%).

This drastic difference may be attributed to the fact that smaller schools have more resources to dedicate to their student population. This can also be seen in the spending ranges per student where the budget per student does not increase significantly and passing rates decrease dramatically.
